Simple Part-of-Speech Tagger (Hidden Markov Model in Python)

Recently, I came across Professor Michael Collins's [collection of lectures](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/) on  statistical natural language processing. Inspired by his first two chapters, I've put together a simple part-of-speech tagger that incorporates many of the concepts covered.

See [this notebook](https://github.com/jtgonz/simple_pos_tagger/blob/master/POS%20Tagging%20in%20Python.ipynb) for details.
